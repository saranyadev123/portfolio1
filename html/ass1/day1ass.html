<h1>ICE CREAM</h1>
<p><b>Ice cream </b>is a frozen dessert typically made from<u> milk or cream that has been flavoured with a sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice, such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit, such as strawberries or peaches.</u> Food colouring is sometimes added in addition to stabilizers. The mixture is cooled <b>below</b> the <b>freezing point of water and stirred to incorporate air spaces and prevent detectable ice crystals from forming. </b>It can also be made by whisking a flavoured cream base and liquid nitrogen together. The result is a <u>smooth, semi-solid foam that is solid at very low temperatures (below 2 °C or 35 °F).</u> It becomes more malleable as its temperature increases.</p>

<h1>History</h1>
<hr>
<b><p><h2>Early frozen desserts</b></P></h2>
<p>The origins of<b> frozen desserts </b>are obscure, although several accounts exist about their history. Some sources describe <b>ice cream</b>-like foods as originating in Persia as far back as 550 BC.[3][4][5] Using <u>ice houses and ice pools, Persians were able to serve and produce faloodeh and sorbets all year round.</u>[6]</p>
<p>A <b>Roman</b> cookbook dating back to the 1st-century includes recipes for sweet desserts that are sprinkled with snow,[7] and there are Persian records from the <u>second century for sweetened drinks chilled with ice.</u>[7]</p>

<b><p><h2>Early modern</b></P></h2>
<p>In the <u>16th century</u>, the<b> Mughal Empire </b>used relays of horsemen to bring ice from the <b>Hindu Kush to its capital, Delhi, used to create kulfi,</b> a popular frozen dairy dessert from the Indian subcontinent often described as <u>"traditional Indian ice cream."</u>[13][better source needed]</p>

<h2>Europe</h2>
<p>The technique of <u>"freezing"</u> was not known from any European sources prior to the 16th century.[12] During the <b>16th century,</b> authors made reference to the refrigerant effect that happened when salt was added to ice, causing it to freeze. However, it was not until the latter part of the <b>17th century</b> that sorbets and ice creams were made using this process.[14]</p>
<p><b>Ice cream's</b> spread throughout Europe is sometimes attributed to Moorish traders, but more often <b>Marco Polo. </b>Though it is not mentioned in any of his writings, Polo is often credited with introducing sorbet-style desserts to Italy after learning of them during his travels to China.[15] According to a<b><u> legend, the Italian duchess Catherine de' Medici</b></u> is said to have introduced flavoured sorbet ices to France when she brought some <b>Italian chefs</b> with her to France upon marrying the<u> Duke of Orléans (Henry II of France) in 1533</u>.[16][17] But in fact, no Italian chefs were present in France during the Medici period,[18] and it is known that ice cream already existed in France before Catherine de Medici was born.[19] One hundred years later, Charles I of England was reportedly so impressed by the "frozen snow" that he offered his own ice cream maker a lifetime pension in return for keeping the formula secret, so that ice cream could be a royal prerogative.[</p>
