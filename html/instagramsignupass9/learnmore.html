    <h2>Information for people who don't use Meta Products</h2>
    <p>Meta Platforms, Inc. ("Meta", "we", "our" or "us") processes your name, mobile phone number and/or your email address if we receive it from our users through the contact uploading or contact syncing feature available on Facebook, Messenger or Instagram ("contact uploading"). We process this information even if you are not a user of Facebook, Messenger or Instagram and/or don't have an account with us (a "non-user").</p>
    <h2>About contact uploading and how it works</h2>
    <p>When a user uses contact uploading and grants us access to their device's address book. We will access and upload the names, phone numbers and email addresses in their address book on a daily basis to our servers, including those of both users of Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram and other contacts who are not users or don't have an account (i.e. non-users).</p>
    <h2>What information is collected about non-users?</h2>
    <p>We collect the name, mobile phone number and/or email address of a user's contacts.</p>
    <h2>How do we use a non-user's information?</h2>
    <p>Contact uploading is an optional feature where users can choose to upload their device's address book to Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram. We process the names, phone numbers and/or email addresses in the address book to see if any of the numbers or email addresses belong to users. If a user's contact is also on Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram, we can suggest this contact on Facebook as someone to send a friend request to in the Facebook user's People you may know or as a suggested account to follow on Instagram. A user's contact who is on Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram may also be recommended people and things that they care about so that we can offer them a better service. Users can also invite non-users to join Facebook, Messenger and/or Instagram via text or email.
        Contact uploading also allows us to suggest a non-user who joins as a user of Facebook as a friend to add for the user through People you may know or as a suggested account to follow on Instagram.<br>
        <bR>
        Finally, we will also use the address books uploaded to investigate suspicious activity on the Meta Products and keep our platform safe and secure. We also conduct business intelligence and analytics using the address books uploaded to accurately count people and users of the Meta Company Products.<br>
        <bR>
        Meta shares information we collect, infrastructure, systems and technology with the other Meta Companies. We share non-users' data with other Meta Companies to be able to provide the contact import feature and for the purposes set out above.
        We retain non-users' personal information for as long as needed to provide the contact importer feature to users and for the purposes described above. In certain cases, we need to keep your contact information for longer, including after you ask us to erase it. This includes for legal reasons such as to respond to a legal request or comply with applicable law, for regulatory or litigation matters, to prevent harm or for safety, security and integrity purposes. The length of time we need to keep it will depend on the specific reason.</p>
